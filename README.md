# Fetal-Health-Prediction
Cardiotocography (CTG) is used during pregnancy to monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. It is monitor fetal well-being and allows early detection of fetal distress. CTG interpretation helps in determining if the pregnancy is high or low risk. An abnormal CTG may indicate the need for further investigations and potential intervention.

We will use machine learning algorithm to predict the fetal health. Fetal Health Classification is the dataset used from kaggle.
